------------------------------------

This code is for fitting a rectangle to a set of data points using the least squares(LS) method. The rectfit function takes a matrix of data points as input and returns the parameters of the fit rectangle, the values of parameters during LS adjustment, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the fit. 

The parameters of the fit rectangle 

xc, ycï¼š x abd y coordinates of centre
mx, my:  edge lengths
alpha: orientation

Here is an example of using the code with some sample data:
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from rectfit import rectfit

data = np.mat([[9.1641, 7.5196], [7.9641, 9.5981],
[6.8094, 8.9314], [3.3453, 6.9314],
[1.3692, 5.0207], [2.3692, 3.2887],
[3.3692, 1.5566], [8.0774, 2.7353],
[9.8094, 3.7353], [10.0641, 5.9608]])

est, vs, rmse = rectfit(data, iter=10)
print('parameters (xc, yc, mx, my, alpha) of fit rectangle is', est.T[0])
```
